The file `academic-recommendation-app/output/recommendations.csv` is an output file and it will be generated by the program when it runs. It will contain the course recommendations for each student. Initially, this file does not exist or is empty until the program is run. Therefore, there is no code to provide for this file. It will be created and written to by the `write_csv` function in the `csv_processor.py` file.
